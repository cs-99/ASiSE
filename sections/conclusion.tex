\section{Conclusion}
This paper provided an overview over the general structure of neural networks. After that, research on implementation approaches, especially analog and mixed hardware-software ones, was discussed.\\
As it turns out, most research today is done for accelerators of neural networks, which try to use both flexibility from software parts and efficiency and speed from hardware parts. Continuous improvements are required in future research in order to keep up with the demand for NNs. One of the main fields of potential improvement, the energy efficiency, might become even more important as NNs are getting bigger and bigger and more widespread.
