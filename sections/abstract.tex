\begin{abstract}
	This paper explains how neural networks work and presents research about their implementation with more focus on analog methods. Thereby different layer types and the neuron as the smallest part of the network are described before the main learning method for neural networks, backpropagation, is briefly covered. A short conclusion about the current state of neural networks and their hardware/software implementation is given, as well as hints into future research topics.
