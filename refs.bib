  abstract   = {Neuromorphic computing is henceforth a major research field for both academic and industrial actors. As opposed to Von Neumann machines, brain-inspired processors aim at bringing closer the memory and the computational elements to efficiently evaluate machine learning algorithms. Recently, spiking neural networks, a generation of cognitive algorithms employing computational primitives mimicking neuron and synapse operational principles, have become an important part of deep learning. They are expected to improve the computational performance and efficiency of neural networks, but they are best suited for hardware able to support their temporal dynamics. In this survey, we present the state of the art of hardware implementations of spiking neural networks and the current trends in algorithm elaboration from model selection to training mechanisms. The scope of existing solutions is extensive; we thus present the general framework and study on a case-by-case basis the relevant particularities. We describe the strategies employed to leverage the characteristics of these event-driven algorithms at the hardware level and discuss their related advantages and challenges.},

  abstract       = {Computer vision is becoming an increasingly trendy word in the area of image processing. With the emergence of computer vision applications, there is a significant demand to recognize objects automatically. Deep CNN (convolution neural network) has benefited the computer vision community by producing excellent results in video processing, object recognition, picture classification and segmentation, natural language processing, speech recognition, and many other fields. Furthermore, the introduction of large amounts of data and readily available hardware has opened new avenues for CNN study. Several inspirational concepts for the progress of CNN have been investigated, including alternative activation functions, regularization, parameter optimization, and architectural advances. Furthermore, achieving innovations in architecture results in a tremendous enhancement in the capacity of the deep CNN. Significant emphasis has been given to leveraging channel and spatial information, with a depth of architecture and information processing via multi-path. This survey paper focuses mainly on the primary taxonomy and newly released deep CNN architectures, and it divides numerous recent developments in CNN architectures into eight groups. Spatial exploitation, multi-path, depth, breadth, dimension, channel boosting, feature-map exploitation, and attention-based CNN are the eight categories. The main contribution of this manuscript is in comparing various architectural evolutions in CNN by its architectural change, strengths, and weaknesses. Besides, it also includes an explanation of the CNN’s components, the strengths and weaknesses of various CNN variants, research gap or open challenges, CNN applications, and the future research direction.},
